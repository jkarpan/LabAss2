1. Compiling

To compile the application, simply
run "make" from the program's
working directory in a terminal.
Program will compile with no issues.

If you wish to remove any additional
unnecessary files, type "make clean"
to remove the executable and any
.o files generated with the build
process.

2. Running

Simply type "./LabAss2" in a terminal
to run the application. You will be
subject to a first round of a game of
craps, then you will win or lose, then
